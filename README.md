### Hi there 👋 I'm André Rocha [@andrecorumba](https://twitter.com/andrecorumba)

🇧🇷 I've been serving as a Senior Auditor at the Comptroller General's Office in Brazil, an agency responsible for internal control and anti-corruption efforts.

📈 Throughout my tenure, I've engaged in extensive cross-referencing of large relational databases, devising auditing trails to uncover fraud and improper use of public funds.

🚀 Currently, I'm focused on developing full-stack Python applications that harness the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks. These tools are crafted to assist auditors in sifting through vast arrays of documents and files, aiming to pinpoint fraudulent activities or irregularities.

🤖 Programming has captivated me since I was 12 years old, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. Ever since, I've been dedicated to integrating computational thinking into solving day-to-day challenges.

#### 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI
- **Caches:** Redis
- **Data Science:** Pandas, PyTorch
- **LLM Framework:** LangChain, LLaMA Index
- **LLM Models:** openai/gpt-4, meta/llama, facebook/seamless,
- **Audio Models:** openai/whisper, alphacep/vosk-model
- **SQL Databases:** Microsoft SQLServer, SQLite
- **Vector Databases:** Redis-Stack, FAISS, ChromaDB
- **DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Docker-Compose, Google Cloud, Git

#### 📚 Projects
- [Inspector](https://github.com/andrecorumba/inspector) - The Inspector is a Proof of Concept (POC) consisting of a web application and scripts, written in Python, that analyze various types of documents. It utilizes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 language models from OpenAI to provide responses based on questions asked by the user.
- [Leia](https://github.com/andrecorumba/leia) - LeIA is an application that uses OpenAI's artificial intelligence models for audio and video transcription. You can transcribe new files or consult cases that have already been transcribed.

#### 🏆 Achievements
- An artificial intelligence solution to analyze documents and assist Brazilian auditors in audit processes, utilizing large language models.
- An advanced artificial intelligence solution designed for analyzing audio recordings, aiding in forensic analysis. This system leverages techniques to assist in the examination of audio data, streamlining the process of uncovering crucial insights for forensic investigations.
- Cross-referencing data to alert about fraud detection in transactions.
