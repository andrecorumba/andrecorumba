### Hi there 👋 I'm André Rocha [@andrecorumba](https://twitter.com/andrecorumba)

### 🌟 About Me:
🤖 Graduated in Computer Engineering since 2003. I've been dedicated to applying computational thinking to overcome real-world challenges. 

### 🚀 What I'm Working On:
🇧🇷 I've been working as a Machine Learning Engineer and Python Developer. Currently, I'm focused on developing Python applications that harness the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks. These tools are crafted to assist auditors in sifting through vast arrays of documents and files, aiming to pinpoint fraudulent activities or irregularities.

### 📈 Expertise and Interests:

- **Data Analysis & Auditing:** Expert in cross-referencing large relational databases, creating auditing trails to detect and prevent fraud in public fund management.
- **Programming & Development:** Proficient in crafting solutions that integrate advanced technologies, focusing on automation, data analysis, and software development.

### 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** FastAPI, Pandas, PyTorch, LangChain, HuggingFace, Transformers
- **Database:** Redis, SQLServer
- **DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Google Cloud

### 📚 Projects
- [Inspector](https://github.com/andrecorumba/inspector) - The Inspector is a Proof of Concept (POC) consisting of a web application and scripts, written in Python, that analyze various types of documents. It utilizes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 language models from OpenAI to provide responses based on questions asked by the user.
- [Leia](https://github.com/andrecorumba/leia) - LeIA is an application that uses OpenAI's artificial intelligence models for audio and video transcription. You can transcribe new files or consult cases that have already been transcribed.

### 🏆 Achievements
- An artificial intelligence solution to analyze documents and assist Brazilian auditors in audit processes, utilizing large language models.
- An advanced artificial intelligence solution designed for analyzing audio recordings, aiding in forensic analysis. This system leverages techniques to assist in the examination of audio data, streamlining the process of uncovering crucial insights for forensic investigations.
- Cross-referencing data to alert about fraud detection in transactions.

### 🌐 Looking Forward:

I am continually seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, diving deeper into the realms of machine learning, data science, and full-stack development. My goal is to create tools and applications that not only solve complex problems but also make a significant impact by improving efficiency and transparency.
